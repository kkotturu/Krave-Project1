# Krave-Project1

First Project for Bootcamp

Krave - Food App

App allows user to make decisions about whether to cook at home or to find food options outside the home. With a simple search of a cuisine or specific dish + zipcode, user will be presented with a instructional video for making searched food or local options where the food may be purchased.

This app utilizes: Google Places API Youtube API Materialize Google Fonts

Database: Firebase

Deployment: Firebase, https://krave-project1.firebaseapp.com/

Authors: Kiran, Alex, Katy, Ethan

Note: Please add CORS extension to the chrome and add the url https://maps.googleapis.com/* to the'Intercecpted URLs and URL patterns and delete ':///*'

The deployment to firebase for this project was challenging.  The part that we came across is CORS and we solved it by adding Chrome CORS extention to the browser and enabling it to show the restaurant part and disabling it to play the video.  WE understand that this is not an ideal way but this worked for us at that time.
